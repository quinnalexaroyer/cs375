# Project Overview

I intend to create a simple humanoid character where the keyboard's cursor keys will make the character walk. It will be animated with geometric deformations. There will be a camera that can also be moved and rotated using keys on the keyboard. I will create the model in Blender 3D and have it print out the coordinates of each vertex and the vertex indices that make up each face. There will be a cube and a sphere on the ground that the model can kick and pick up. I will use a directional light source.

# Project Schedule

* Week 1: Create the humanoid model and load it in the scene. Set up the camera and directional light source.
* Week 2: Set up animation for walking. Set it up so the keyboard can make the character walk, kick, and move as though it were picking up an object.
* Week 3: Make the sphere and the cube interactive so the character can kick them and pick them up.
* Week 4: Fix any issues that come up. Implement any features I was not able to finish in the time planned. Work on project presentation.

# Project Technical Requirements

I intend to use Three.js and Javascript.
